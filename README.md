# kpi-pal-lab3
Program for sorting files with 64-bit numbers (radix sort, merge sort).

In the main file, the mode variable is responsible for the size of the file that will be generated, read and sorted. In the sorted file all numbers will be presented without repetition and with the first line indicating where they are located in the input file.

A third-party mt64.h file was used in the project to generate random 64-bit unsigned numbers.
